2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.519
From fairest creatures we desire increase,

3
00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.640
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.640
But as the riper should by time decease,

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.439
His tender heir might bear his memory:

6
00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.559
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,

7
00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:22.760
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.480
Making a famine where abundance lies,

9
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.239
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

10
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.399
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,

11
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.600
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.640
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.119
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,

15
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:53.240
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
